"To ask advice or feedback and get people to open up, you have to make them uncomfortable, otherwise they'll say you're doing great and will try to move on. Try just sitting there silently. Figure out a way to make it impossible for people not to tell you what they really think, because if they can get out of telling you what you're doing wrong, they will."
